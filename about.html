     <h2> About Me</h2>
 <p> Hi! My name is Teri Appleton and I am from San Francisco originally and I currently live in Sonoma. I am taking this class to complete the web development certificate and eventually the Associates program. I am doing this to change careers. Over the past two years, I attempted to teach myself, but I do better in a structured learning environment, so here I am.  </p>

   
<p>To decide on an animal for this project, I asked my husband to <q>name an animal, any animal</q> and he blurted out <q>armadillo!</q> I thoght it was a great choice. I really enjoyed making these pages and learning about armadillos, HTML and CSS. Early on, I intended to create a theme that was unique and a bit wild, so I chose dark and loud colors. However I realized that accessibility would be an issue. In the end I chose more neutral and readable colors and fonts. I look forward to finding some balance in the future and creating interesting, unique looking pages that are still readable and accessible.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Suprises</h2>
<p>The greatest challenge in completing this project was debugging. I spent a considerable amount of time finding and correcting errors. Usually something very small like a missing qoutation mark or closing bracket. On the plus side, I found it to be satisfying work. If my page was not displaying properly, it was a relief to find that it was only a minor issue (usually) and I otherwise was on the right track! The other challange is learning all the nuances of css, but again, it was very rearding and satisyfing once everything start to click and make sense. </p>




<p>What suprised me most learning about Armadillos is how vast their habotat is in the Americas and that there are so many species.</p>
